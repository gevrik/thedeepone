  text: "From: Riviera, Neil\nTo: report@ashpool.fr.eu\n\nThe gangers have taken my orders about our high-priority targets wihtout complaint, but I am afraid we will have to rethink the plan very soon.\n\nOne of our high profile targets, Codename:Charlie, was seen delivering a package to the museum last night. I am sure that the package contained some new research material for Dr. Armitage to work on. We might have to use the gang leader to gain access to the museum and find out what kind of research material they are having him investigate. This could be invaluable for our operation.\n\nI will order our gangers to tail Dr. Armitage and to find a way for us to gain access to the museum when he is not there, so I can take a look around. "

To bolster their morale I have spent 5,000Y on new equipment that was delivered to the parking garage.\n\nReports suggest that Dr. Armitage almost never leaves the museum - he is working non-stop on the research material delivered to him by DAGON. This suggests that he is indeed working on high-priority projects that will be of interest to us. It is now more important to gain access to the museum and take a look at his research.\n\nI am requesting two additional Reavers, as I have no confidence in our minions to be up for an infiltration mission... I might also need a Decker to access the museums internal Matrix system.\n\nPlease reply with an ETA for the requested personnel."
