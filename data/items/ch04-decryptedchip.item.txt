We suspect that the flatline has become the target of a group of individuals that have been responsible for the incident in our Tacoma Zeitgeist Robotics office.\n\nWe want you to investigate who these people are, they have already stolen some of our assets and are highly dangerous. Once you have enough data on the subjects please contact you handler at Ashpool Systems for further instructions and backup. I repeat, these people you are investigating are very dangerous, do not seek an open confrontation with them! We have already established the handle of the main target, $(l.his) handle is $(l.name).\n\nWe have booked rooms in the Tacoma Industrial District Coffin Hotel and the Everett Downtown Hotel for you, paid for 30 days in advance.\n\nATTACHMENTS:\n\nAshpool Systems Inc.
